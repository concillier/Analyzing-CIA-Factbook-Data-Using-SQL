Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

Doing a lot of exploratory analysis with data from: factbook.db >> https://github.com/factbook

This data is interesting for people who: 
- Will probably watch National Geographic
- Are curious about the world
- Probably love travel, discovery and being global citizens
- Also great for introducing kids to geography in a fun, discovery way. 

The main questions that I answer at the end of the analysis include: 

1. Getting an overview of the data

2. Summary statistics of the world's largest and smallest country population and sizes/areas

3. Exploration of outliers

4. Exploring average population and area

5. Discovering densely populated areas (where population > average and area < average

6. Discovering which countries have the highest ratios of water to land where water area > land

7. Discovering which countries will add the most people to their population next year

8. Finding out which countries have a higher death rate than birth rate //this should be alarming
